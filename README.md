# pi-tradebot
Cryptocurrency Trading Bot that runs on a Raspberry Pi.
As of now, I am testing and improving it on my laptop since I don't have access to a wired connection like I did during the summer. It times out and breaks often, especially overnight. 

The .py file (neobot) used to run on the Raspberry Pi.
The .ipynb file is used for testing, debugging, and coding on my laptop. It also contains the output from the last run.
